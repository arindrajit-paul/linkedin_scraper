# Project Summary
This project is a simple implementation of `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries in Python. The project is a simple web scraper that scrapes the top 25 entry jobs in Data Analytics. The scraper scrapes the job title, company name, location, and the link to the job posting. The scraped data is then saved in a CSV file.
